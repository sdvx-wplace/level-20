## Drawing

Note: from version 07, **all colors including non-default ones** will be used.

You may draw any part of the image, but for maximal effectiveness, here are non-mandatory guidelines:

- Draw black margins first.
- Draw object boundaries first.

Here are some dimensions, by the way:

- Each jacket's size is exactly 100-by-100 pixels.
- Black borders surrounding each jacket are 2 pixels wide.
- Neighboring jackets are separated by 14 pixel gaps (excluding borders), both horizontally and vertically.

## AMOGUS

Yes, amogi drawn on the right side of jackets are part of the template.
Can you guess what's their purpose?
