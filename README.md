## Jacket Status

The initial dithering is not clean, so they should be manually adjusted.

- **Unlisted**: Not yet adjusted, adjustment likely needed.
- **Unstable**: Adjusted, but further change is expected to happen.
- **Stable**: Adjusted, further change may possible but likely in a minor way.

**It is recommended to work on 'Stable' jackets first, then 'Unstable'. Works on unlisted jackets are likely to be overwritten.**

## Drawing

Note: from version 07, **all colors including non-default ones** will be used.

You may draw any part of the image, but for maximal effectiveness, here are non-mandatory guidelines:

- Draw black margins first.
- Draw object boundaries first.

Here are some dimensions, by the way:

- Each jacket's size is exactly 100-by-100 pixels.
- Black borders surrounding each jacket are 2 pixels wide.
- Neighboring jackets are separated by 14 pixel gaps (excluding borders), both horizontally and vertically.
