## Drawing

In addition to default 31 colors, the following non-default colors have been added to the palette:

- Dark Red
- Dark Peach
- Peach
- Light Beige
- Light Stone

These colors have been carefully chosen to improve the quality of dithered image.

You may draw any part of the image, but for maximal effectiveness, here are non-mandatory guidelines:

- Draw black margins first.
- Draw object boundaries first.

Here are some dimensions, by the way:

- Each jacket's size is exactly 100-by-100 pixels.
- Black borders surrounding each jacket are 2 pixels wide.
- Neighboring jackets are separated by 14 pixel gaps (excluding borders), both horizontally and vertically.
